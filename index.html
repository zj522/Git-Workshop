            <h2 class="prompt">Deep Dive Group Project: Accessible Communication Technologies</h2>
            <h3 class = "authors">By: Cynthia, Jantima, Leonore, Martin</h3>
            <time timedate="2016-09-23" pubdate>September 29, 2016</time>
            <p>With this Deep Dive Project, we aim to explore one of the aspects of technology that can easily be taken for granted; accessibility. Although most would agree that everybody should have equal access to technology, it sometimes becomes challenging to ensure this in a system where the main audience is young and healthy. There are many ways to discriminate between subgroups of the population (politically, economically, socially, etc.), but for this Deep Dive project we chose to focus on visual impairment. It is not solely that our modern society is highly screen-based, but also that degradation in eyesight becomes frequent with age in a substantial part of the general population. Thus, it is a challenge that the majority of us will be forced to confront at some point in life. </p>
            <p>The layout of the class is divided into three main sections: a) Introduction, b) Demo/Practical Experiences and c) Discussion/Debrief. With the introductory part, we want to get the other students in the class to start thinking of the different aspects of accessibility. Hence, we start with a broad definition, which then gradually leads towards the specific sub-topic of our focus: screen reading as a tool for people with visual impairment. This would serve as a transition into the VoiceOver demo (part b), to show one of the widely used tools to access modern communication technologies (iOS devices) in action. Although we decided to concentrate on iOS devices here, as it is one of the easiest and most efficient to use, there are analogues for other interfaces/devices. </p>
            <p>The main section of the Deep Dive are the two practical tasks. Students are divided into groups of two, and each person experiences one of the tasks. The ulterior motive of the first (sending an email with voiceover while being blindfolded) is to make people experience how heavily we rely on our vision when using the communication interfaces on our phones. Something as banal as sending an email suddenly requires a lot of time and attention. Furthermore, screen reading will hopefully also make the students aware of how vision is built into the design; the system becomes quite inefficient when one is not able to see the icons and space the apps are physically mapped to. The students will experience the hurdles when navigating the phone and writing the messages, but will simultaneously have support from their partner. </p>
            <p>After a quick discussion about the VoiceOver experience, we plan to transition to the second task, with which we hope to show how web pages can be designed in an accessible or inaccessible way. We want them to actually experience the frustration when descriptions are too long, the order messy and the navigation inconvenient. Together with the subsequent explanation slides, they will hopefully have a better understanding of the “golden standards” (W3C) for web accessibility and why it should be part of every webpage and mobile application. </p>
            <p>Most of all, our goal with this session is to make the other students reflect about the topic of accessibility and understand why everybody should care about this. We hope to give them an overview over accessibility and equip them with a set of basic tools that will enable them to design their websites in a more inclusive and accessible way. </p>

            <h2 class="prompt">Ideas for Analysis Paper "Home"</h2>
            <time timedate="2016-09-23" pubdate>September 23, 2016</time>
            <p>The first idea I got for the analysis paper is to write about Chinese kite. The kite is widely regarded as an ancient invention in China. The earliest prototype is believed to be made by Chinese philosopher Mozi and his disciple Lu Ban in the 5th Century. Back then, the kite was named “mu yuan” (wooden bird) because it was mainly made of wood and its shape resembled a bird. According to some ancient historical documents, the earliest kite was used for military purposes. For example, Lu Ban himself used it to spy on the enemy army. Later on, people started to build paper kites with bamboo framework (ribs). During and after the Tang Dynasty (CE 618-907), because of the development of Chinese culture and economy, flying paper and silk kites became a common entertainment both at court and among the regular people. Kite-flying has also been regarded as a sort of sport. Nowadays, people still fly kites in public to have fun and interact (communicate) with fellow kite-flyers. I remember flying kites with my grandpa and my childhood friends in public parks and squares when I was a kid. I think it’s particularly interesting to learn that Chinese kite was invented as a military communication technology only, but later evolved into a public, collective entertainment enjoyed by numerous groups of people. Certainly, the development of Chinese kite is intertwined with the social, economic and political situations in China throughout the many dynasties after its invention. It would also be interesting for me to do some research on how Chinese kite spread to the rest of the world and adapted to various cultures around the globe (Right now all I know is that the kite was introduced to Europe by Marco Polo). </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The second idea is to discuss Fenghuo Tai (Beacon Towers) on the Great Wall. Back in China, we all learned the history of the Beacon Towers in elementary schools. Basically, beacon towers were constructed on the Great Wall for Chinese soldiers to communicate military information among themselves during and after the Han Dynasty. The Great Wall was guarded against the Xiongnu rangers from the North. If the Chinese guards sense their enemy approaching, they would light up fire on the Beacon Tower to give signals to the rest of the army on dozens of other towers. There were certain codes for signaling so that the Beacon Towers can send various messages about the defense situation, and each soldier on the wall was strictly trained to perform the process. This form of communication has been proved efficient throughout the ancient Chinese history, and has been preserved till the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). For this topic, I would like to look into how the Beacon Towers actually work in detail, and how they change over time to suit specific purposes in each dynasty. Also, I can dig deeper and try to find how these Beacon Towers might have influenced non-military communication technologies in Northern China. </p>

                <h2 class="prompt">Chinese Conceptual Emojis</h2>
                <time timedate="2016-09-20" pubdate>September 20, 2016</time>
            <p><strong>First Entry</strong></p>
            <p>I started designing Chinese Conceptual Emojis by thinking about what existing emojis are unique to the Chinese culture that I am familiar with. The first thing that came to mind was the Mid-Autumn Festival, because this is the latest traditional Chinese festival that everyone in China celebrates (this year the date is Sept 15th). The image of a bunny holding a mooncake (the traditional pastry associated with this Festival, see below a picture of the real cake) came to mind. I basically started drawing the bunny’s head with its long ears and bunny tooth (the goatee is a bonus). Then I drew the front-side of a large mooncake in the bunny’s arms. The four Chinese characters on the cake means, guess what, “Happy Mid-Autumn Festival”! Characters printed on mooncakes is very common in China, which often indicate what fillings are in this cake. But I just wanted to highlight this emoji’s association with the festival, so these four characters appeared instead.  </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./emoji_pic/cantonese_mooncake.jpg" alt="Chinese-Mooncake-Cantonese-Style" width=400> <br>
                <figcaption>Chinese Mooncake (Cantonese Style)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <img class ="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/Mid_Autumn_Bunny.jpeg" alt="Mid-Autumn-Festival-Bunny" width=400>
            <p>So I scanned my drawing and showed it to a Chinese friend. She was (kinda) impressed by the appearance of the bunny (her original words are, it looks pretty funny), and she immediately thought of various other stickers/emojis that people use to wish one another happy (other) festivals. I think this reaction is important, because it indicates how often Chinese people socialize with stickers and emojis to express their feelings, rather than just texting with words, as well as the number of sticker collections people are exposed to on a daily basis. In addition, she thinks I should color it. Then I showed it to one of my suitemate. She reacted by saying the whole emoji is too complicated. If it were real emoji-size, you can’t really see the details, like the Chinese characters. She also thought the bunny is the highlight because it looks funny. </p>
            <img class ="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/WeChat_Logo.png" alt="WeChat-Logo" width=300> <br>
            <img class ="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/WeChat_WeFright.jpeg" alt="WeChat-V.S.-WeFright" width=500>
            <p>Speaking of WeChat, I myself was so very conscious about the fact that it is <em>the most popular </em> social media application all around mainland China (See above its logo). So my second try on designing a conceptual emoji is to mock the WeChat logo. Originally, the logo consists of two personalized white text bubbles against a green background. I substituted the text bubbles with two white ghost and named it “WeFright”. The first viewer was rather amused, and claimed that I have a very dry sense of humor. Why not. The second viewer laughed at it as well, and suggested that I add some extra strokes to give the ghosts a sense of motion, as if they were actually floating above the ground. Both viewers are perfectly familiar with the context, they know the logo and the name of the app, and they even know why this design is relevant to how people use stickers and emojis in general — to mock and/or make fun of things. A well-known example is, the WeChat smile emoji now has become one that expresses frustration and sarcasm towards people/things you don’t like: <br>
            <img class ="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/smile.jpeg" alt="Sarcastic-Smile-Emoji" width=250> </p>
            <img class ="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/Taking_Meds.jpeg" alt="Taking-Meds" width=350> 
            <p>I got the idea for the third emoji from a series of stickers that already existed again on WeChat — the alpaca series. The alpaca is depicted as an adorable animal, and I just wanted to exaggerate it by letting it take pills instead of… grass. Also, “taking meds” has a special meaning in Chinese pop culture. I think it means the sender and/or receiver of this kind of emoji want to make fun of themselves as being irrational and ridiculous. Often, stickers/emojis like this are meant for filling the gaps in a social-media conversation where no words can fit, so that people in that conversation feel somewhat more comfortable and natural to interact. The first viewer thought the concept is nice, but what it conveys is ambiguous. She also had this feeling of ambiguity towards many other emojis, exactly because their meanings are often flexible. The other viewer thought I should add more pills, for example in the background, or make the sticker a gif so that the alpaca has an endless supply of pills. I like this idea a lot. </p> 
            <p><strong>Second Entry</strong> <br>
            I made some changes to my three Conceptual Emojis by first coloring them, and second adding more details. The Mid-Autumn bunny now looks like this: </p>
            <img class="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/bunny2.jpeg" alt="Revised-Mid-Autumn-Bunny" width="300">
            <p>There are still details that probably can’t be seen probably if it were the size of Emojis. But when I showed it to a friend and mentioned this concern. He replied that Apple has integrated larger-size stickers in iMessage for the latest iOS 10. I myself also think many times larger-size stickers express emotions more precisely than the original small emojis. The second viewer pointed out the use of this kind of stickers/emojis is too limited because it’s strongly related to one specific festival. Another feedback was, the comical-looking bunny twisted what “Happy Mid-Autumn Festival” means in words. The bunny makes the whole emoji seem teasing. </p>
            <img class="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/WeFright2.jpeg" alt="Revised-WeFright" width="300">
            <p>The enhanced WeFright emoji didn’t make people laugh as much as it did with the first two viewers. The two friends to which I showed the colored version both thought they don’t know how to use it. They got the idea that it came from WeChat, but didn’t know under which conditions would people actually use it to express any emotions. I agree with them to some extent. This WeFright idea came to mind pretty randomly, and I didn’t think about its usage at the beginning. </p>
            <img class="emoji" src="./emoji_pic/alpaca2.jpeg" alt="Revised-Taking-Meds" width="500">
            <p>The alpaca taking meds emoji is my personal favorite. This time I decided to give the alpaca an abundant supply of pills ;). The two viewers understood its meaning immediately, even though I did not add any words to explain it. One of them said taking meds is a very common joke in WeChat conversations and online communication in general. It “implies” yourself/the other person have mental problems and need meds all the time. Of course, it’s only a joke and nobody (hopefully) is going to be offended. One of the viewers said he wouldn’t be sure foreigners can easily understand this Chinese “subculture” of using stickers to express both jokes and sarcasm. And it would be interesting to see how my classmates (and you, Craig) react to it. </p>

                <h2 class="prompt">12-Hour Mission: Live Without Electronics</h2>
                <time timedate="2016-09-03" pubdate>September 10, 2016</time>
            <span class="more">
            <p>On September 10th, 2016, I survived the day without my phone, my laptop or anyone else’s. In retrospect, it didn’t feel as miserable as I had expected. Not using electronic devices for 12 hours did cause some tiny troubles, but overall I actually felt relieved not being compelled to check my phone (most of the time, social media) repeatedly. Here are the journal entries I wrote every 3 hours from 9AM that day:
<!--                <button class="read-more">Read More</button></p>-->
            <p><span class="firstWord">12:00 PM</span><br>
                Up to now it doesn’t feel super bad, probably because I got up pretty late – about 10 minutes before 9. I quickly checked my email, messaged my mom about this 12-hour mission without any contact with the outside world, and shut down my phone just before 9. Afterwards, a few friends and I went to the Mina Fish Market. We got some grilled fish and shrimps back to campus, then had our meal at the Marketplace. We were eating first with knifes and folks, but soon we started grabbing things to our mouths with our hands. I realized I was not the only one who was not using her phone, no one else at our table checked their electronic devices at all, because of their greasy hands.</p>

            <p><span class="firstWord">15:00 PM</span><br>
                I went back to the dorm after we played some Ping-Pong and Foosball at the activity zone. Now I can name some inconveniences this experiment causes and why I now feel frustrated: First of all, no music. I’d better go to sleep without playing some music when I’m alone in the dorm! Secondly, my watch is broken but I can’t google what’s wrong with it. The amusing part is, because phones and computers are not allowed, and my watch stopped behaving, I have no idea what time it is now. I’ll just wait for my suitemates I guess.</p>

            <p><span class="firstWord">18:00 PM</span><br>
                Nothing happened since three hours ago. I felt so bored that I went for a nap. Then I read the Artificial Ape and realized that I am a modern human who is deeply shaped by and attached to technology. I admit it alright. My brain size probably shrank as I grew up.LOL.</p>

            <p><span class="firstWord">21:00 PM</span><br>
                Last entry for the day and I’m back to my comfort zone full of tech. How should I put it… it was not so bad a day, but it’s probably because I did this during the Eid break. I can’t imagine going through a whole weekday without using either my phone or my laptop. After all, I’m used to walking, sitting, eating and sleeping with my phone within 5 meters from myself. But it’s also good to get detached from time to time. I’m sure I can survive many more such experiments during future breaks!</p>

		      <h2 class="prompt">What Does Communication and Technology Mean to Me?</h2>
                <time timedate="2016-09-03" pubdate>September 3, 2016</time>
            <p> Communication is a natural human urge to reach out to other human beings (and in some cases other species), in order to exchange ideas, emotions, and other information. Communication existed when humans first needed to cooperate with one another for their survival several million years ago. Communication has since become a crucial part of our nature, for no one ever lived in pure isolation (Henry David Thoreau isolated himself in nature for quite some time, but not forever). Around the world across a vast time span, people have developed various ways and numerous tools to communicate. Cave drawings convey meaning, so does modern languages; African drum have long served the purpose of giving signals and even telling jokes within the local community, while nowadays smart phones become essential whenever anyone needs to call/message someone else. I tend to believe the need for interaction at all levels has always been there; humans are born “social”, because they cannot live alone, physically or psychologically. 
		      </p>
		      <p>The concept of <em>information</em> is crucial when it comes to understanding how communication technology is integrated into our modern society. In the prologue of The Information, James Gleick compares information with Newton’s concept of force, mass, and time; information can also be quantified and measured by bits. He further proposes <i>“we can see now that information is what our world runs on… It pervades the sciences from top to bottom, transforming every branch of knowledge”</i>(Gleick 8). This assertion is at least partially true. From what I experienced, the ability to gather, understand and process information has become essential for the study of all the sciences and engineering. Its influence also extends to arts and design. More recently the idea of big data pervades, and of course, data is information.
		      </p>
		      <p>Technology is what makes all this possible. It is the medium through which instant, highly reliable communication flourish. We all benefit from the advancement of communication technology on a daily basis. On the other hand, people do have certain doubts about technology. Gleick mentions information fatigue, and E.M. Forster imagined a world where most people are manipulated by the Machine. One shady side of technology is, even the ones who embrace it the most are not completely sure to which direction it is evolving. The question “can we really trust robots (and now Artificial Intelligence)” still stimulates debates. Movies describing future disasters caused by the abuse of technology highlight the concern that we cannot control our powerful tech properly. In <i>The Machine Stops</i>, Forster suggests people could become nunconscious slaves of advanced technology, and abandon face-to-face communication. In this sense, technology merely improves the efficiency of communication, we humans are the ones to decide how we should use technology to communicate and deal with the explosion of information.
